# "HTML5 Website Designing"
### Directions

There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files.

All images are provided in the img folder.

If you need to find taco emojis, try Emojipedia.

A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page
